# XamarinAppStartupTime
Xamarin Forms app that demonstrates how to measure total app startup time in xamarin android

It uses custom android-specific helper to fetch first log entry associated with our application from logcat and parse it's timestamp which is later assumed as startup time of application.

Some screenshots, for some reason I'm getting higher startup time with app built on Visual Studio 2019.
